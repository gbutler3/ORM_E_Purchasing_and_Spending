# ORM E Purchasing and Spending

## Task

Build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Goals

- When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- When I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
